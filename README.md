There is a lot of discussion about whether or not the random numbers that
determine if you get a shiny in Pokémon Go are fair, or if some accounts are
actually biased in a way that means that they get more shinies than others.
If you just compare yourself to your friends, it certainly seems like some
people get more than their share of luck!

The actual mechanics of Pokémon Go are unknown, but this simulation uses
fair random numbers, like rolling a dice, with no bias towards any
particular virtual "account" within the simulation.

The simulation shows that even with fair random numbers, there is more than
enough variance to explain why some of your friends' accounts seem to be
biased.

After building this and playing with it for a while, I believe that
rather than some of the theories about the random number generator being
seeded by your account ID or similar, it really is just luck.

The feeling that some people have "biased" accounts is caused by the small
sample size of how many people you personally know, and the relatively small
(typically tens of thousands) number of encounters any one player can have
had over the lifetime of the game so far.
