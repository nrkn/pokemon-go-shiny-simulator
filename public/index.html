  <h1>Pokémon Go Shiny Simulator</h1>
  <p>
    There is a lot of discussion about whether or not the random numbers that
    determine if you get a shiny in Pokémon Go are fair, or if some accounts are
    actually biased in a way that means that they get more shinies than others.
    If you just compare yourself to your friends, it certainly seems like some
    people get more than their share of luck!
  </p>
  <p>
    The actual mechanics of Pokémon Go are unknown, but this simulation uses
    fair random numbers, like rolling a dice, with no bias towards any
    particular virtual "account" within the simulation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The simulation shows that even with fair random numbers, there is more than
    enough variance to explain why some of your friends' accounts seem to be
    biased.
  </p>
  <p>
    After building this and playing with it for a while, I believe that
    rather than some of the theories about the random number generator being
    seeded by your account ID or similar, it really is just luck.
  </p>
  <p>
    The feeling that some people have "biased" accounts is caused by the small
    sample size of how many people you personally know, and the relatively small
    (typically tens of thousands) number of encounters any one player can have
    had over the lifetime of the game so far.
